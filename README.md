# DVHacks - Tinco

## Project Introduction

OneGov creates the Amazon Prime experience for government services. As a first step and MVP, we created a virtual assistant to get rid of the long DMV wait times. 

#### Problem

People spend hours or even days in many DMV sites to have their vehicle registration & ID/DL renewed.
The existing online digital applications or kiosks are unintuitive, confusing, and limited. 

#### Solution

We designed a virtual assistant that disrupts the market. It leverages advanced AI technologies to save 
people's time. Seriously, you can renew your vehicle registration in 30 seconds!
